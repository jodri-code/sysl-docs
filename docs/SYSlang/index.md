# SYSlang Docs

### [Head back to the start of the docs](https://systemware.ga/)

Welcome to the SYSlang Section of the Docs! This section is written by V1RU5. This guide will teach you SYSlang, show some useful libraries and some code examples.

I would like to thank the following people:
- The [CKS Dev Team](https://github.com/CKStudios2018) for the lang basics, hosting the file server for SYStemware and allowing me to use GOV.CKS project.
- [redir110](https://github.com/redir110) for writing the basic Wiki.
- My secretary, Jule, for proof reading.
- And, of course, [PipeWarp](https://github.com/PipeWarp), for allowing me to give a home to these docs originally on [his site!](https://docs.pipewarp.co.uk/)!!

# To follow along in this guide, you will need:
* A PC (preferably running Windows or Linux, but if you have SYStemware that would be even better)
* Decent Knowledge in Python & Lua, as the language is apparently similar
* An internet connection
* Some free time

_This guide is separated in **two** halves: The language, and the OS._

**Have fun using SYSlang!**
